# DevSecOps Demo: Automated CI/CD Pipeline for Secure Kubernetes Deployment

## üöÄ Overview

This project demonstrates a full **DevSecOps pipeline** for a modern TypeScript (React) web application, with security and automation as first-class citizens.

- **CI/CD** with GitHub Actions
- **Containerization** and security scanning
- **Infrastructure as Code** (IaC) and GitOps deployment
- **Automated K8s image updates**
- **Private registry & secret management**

Everything is designed to reflect real-world, production-ready practices‚Äîperfect for cloud consulting, SaaS, or public sector environments.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
- **Containerization:** Docker, GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
- **Security:** Trivy (container vulnerability scanning)
- **Kubernetes:** Kind (local), Helm (deployment packaging), ArgoCD (GitOps deployment)
- **IaC:** Terraform (for AWS/EKS, in full stack version)
- **App:** TypeScript, React, Vite, Node.js

## üèóÔ∏è Pipeline Architecture

The diagram below illustrates the end-to-end flow of the DevSecOps pipeline‚Äîfrom code commit to secure deployment on Kubernetes using GitHub Actions, Trivy, GHCR, and ArgoCD.

1. **Test & Lint:**  
   Ensures code quality using Vitest and ESLint.
2. **Build:**  
   Compiles the React app for production.
3. **Dockerize:**  
   Builds a Docker image, tags it using the commit SHA (guaranteed lowercase, GH best practice).
4. **Trivy Security Scan:**  
   Blocks pipeline if CRITICAL or HIGH vulnerabilities are found.
5. **Push to GHCR:**  
   Uploads image only if scan passes.
6. **GitOps K8s Deployment:**  
   Automatically updates the Kubernetes deployment YAML with the new image, commits to Git, and triggers ArgoCD for hands-off deployment.

## üîí Security Highlights

- **Trivy Scanning:** All images are scanned before being pushed/deployed.
- **Image Names:** All lowercase and SHA-tagged (resolves real-world K8s issues).
- **K8s Secrets:** Pulling private images is secured with `docker-registry` secrets.

---

## üìã Step-by-Step Pipeline

1. **On every push to `main`:**
   - Run unit tests (Vitest)
   - Run static analysis (ESLint)
   - Build production app

2. **Docker & Security:**
   - Build Docker image (`ghcr.io/deepakrajravi/devsecops:sha-<sha>`)
   - Scan with Trivy (fail pipeline if vulnerabilities found)
   - Push image to GHCR

3. **Kubernetes GitOps:**
   - Auto-update `deployment.yaml` to use the new image (guaranteed lowercase)
   - Commit & push YAML (triggers ArgoCD for real deployment)
   - All changes are traceable and auditable in Git

## üö¶ Usage

**Clone the repo, then:**

```sh
# Run locally (optional)
npm install
npm run dev

# Build and run Docker locally
docker build -t devsecops-demo:latest .
docker run -p 1010:80 devsecops-demo:latest
```

**K8s Deployment (Kind/Minikube):**
- Install ArgoCD and create required secrets.

## üí° Business Value

- **Security as Code:** Vulnerabilities are blocked before reaching production.
- **Reliability:** Automated, repeatable pipeline ensures deployments are consistent and fast.
- **Traceability:** Every change is logged, auditable, and instantly rollbackable with GitOps.
- **Real-World Ready:** Solves real issues (case-sensitivity, private registry, automated updates) seen in enterprise cloud environments.

## üìù Key Learnings

- End-to-end CI/CD, not just build-and-deploy
- The importance of security scanning (and how to integrate it)
- K8s + GitOps practices for scalable, production-ready delivery
- Debugging real-world DevOps issues (image tags, lowercase, secrets)
- How modern teams deliver secure cloud software at speed
